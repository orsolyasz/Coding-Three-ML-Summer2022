Wing Night is Monday & Wednesday night, $0.75 whole wings!\\n\\nThe dining area is nice. Very family friendly! The bar is very nice is well.

I called him this morning for some sprinkler help and some potential landscaping for my backyard. He showed up to my house within an hour and answered all of my questions! When I showed him how my irrigation box was leaking, he knew right away what to do - he went a grabbed a new part out of his truck, put it on, and it was fixed! He then set up my watering timer and we talked about some landscaping and pricing. His prices seemed great and I will definitely use him in the future! To top it all off, when I asked him what I owed him for fixing my irrigation leak and his time, he said don't worry about it! I was shocked and couldn't believe his service! Thank you so much Ryan!  \n",

I always find something (usually I find 3-4 things and spend about $60) and better still, I am always still wearing the clothes and shoes 3 months later. \\n\\nI kind of suspect this is the best shopping in Pittsburgh; it's much better than the usual department stores, better than Marshall's and TJ Maxx and better than the Saks downtown, even when it has a sale. Selection, bargains AND quality.\\n\\nI like this Filene's better than Gabriel Brothers, which are harder to get to. Gabriel Brothers are a real discount shopper's challenge and I'm afraid I didn't live in Pittsburgh long enough to develop the necessary skills . . . Filene's was still up and running in June 2007 when I left town.</td>\n",

More than enough to share, but so good that one may not want to, it was largely due to my early hour of arrival that the Jumbo Bear Claw stuffed with ample amounts of cinnamon apples outshined any similar pastry in the city and although the combination of rich chocolate and substantial notes of cinnamon may not appeal to every palate the crispy exterior and soft insides of the gnarly horn was a veritable cornucopia of flavor, the warm delivery making the aromatics even more impactful and the chocolate just messy enough to justify the use of a fork and knife.\\n\\nUndoubtedly the best all-around doughnuttery in Las Vegas - Artisan, Old School, or Otherwise.</td>\n",

Very little was required as I have desert landscaping and pretty much maintained it myself.  Just needed blowing and general light cleanup.  Ryan was very thorough.\\nThen his brother, I believe, would  come out.  I would have to watch him as if I was not looking, it would be a pretty much \\\"hit and run\\\" literally.\\nI was expecting them Friday.  No show, no call as they never call when they cannot make it.  I have to call them and ask where they are or if they are coming.   Finally a text back saying they will be there Monday as they are running late.\\n\\nMonday comes and again no call no show.  I texted them...no answer...I was very upset at this point as I asked if they would trim a tree that is coming into my yard from a neighbor.  Mind you, there is very little to do here...no grass...no weeds..no plants to constantly trim.  I felt that I asked them to trim a tree and they could not be bothered.\\n\\nI am extremely disappointed in this company as they start out fine and as it continues, they seem to take their customer's for granted.  NO COMMUNICATION...NOT EVEN A CALL WHEN THEY CANNOT COME.   \\n\\nSORRY RYAN, I WILL TAKE MY BUSINESS ELSEWHERE.  AS A BUSINESS OWNER, YOU SHOULD KNOW BETTER!!!!</td>\n",

Other auto mechanics have been notorious for capitalizing on my ignorance of cars, and have sucked my bank account dry. But here, my service and road coverage has all been well explained - and let up to me to decide. \\nAnd they just renovated the waiting room. It looks a lot better than it did in previous years.  \n",

I also went in this week for them to fix a minor problem with a tire they put on. They \\\"fixed\\\" it for free, and the very next morning I had the same issue. I called to complain, and the \\\"manager\\\" didn't even apologize!!! So frustrated. Never going back.  They seem overpriced, too.  \n",

Unfortunately the service is very hit or miss. The main issue seems to be with the kitchen, the waiters and waitresses are often very apologetic for the long waits and it's pretty obvious that some of them avoid the tables after taking the initial order to avoid hearing complaints.  \n",

I always find something (usually I find 3-4 things and spend about $60) and better still, I am always still wearing the clothes and shoes 3 months later. \\n\\nI kind of suspect this is the best shopping in Pittsburgh; it's much better than the usual department stores, better than Marshall's and TJ Maxx and better than the Saks downtown, even when it has a sale. Selection, bargains AND quality.\\n\\nI like this Filene's better than Gabriel Brothers, which are harder to get to. Gabriel Brothers are a real discount shopper's challenge and I'm afraid I didn't live in Pittsburgh long enough to develop the necessary skills . . . Filene's was still up and running in June 2007 when I left town.  \n",

I would have to watch him as if I was not looking, it would be a pretty much \\\"hit and run\\\" literally.\\nI was expecting them Friday.  No show, no call as they never call when they cannot make it.  I have to call them and ask where they are or if they are coming.   Finally a text back saying they will be there Monday as they are running late.\\n\\nMonday comes and again no call no show.  I texted them...no answer...I was very upset at this point as I asked if they would trim a tree that is coming into my yard from a neighbor.  Mind you, there is very little to do here...no grass...no weeds..no plants to constantly trim.

Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them.

He showed up to my house within an hour and answered all of my questions! When I showed him how my irrigation box was leaking, he knew right away what to do - he went a grabbed a new part out of his truck, put it on, and it was fixed! He then set up my watering timer and we talked about some landscaping and pricing. His prices seemed great and I will definitely use him in the future! To top it all off, when I asked him what I owed him for fixing my irrigation leak and his time, he said don't worry about it! I was shocked and couldn't believe his service! Thank you so much Ryan!</td>\n",

It seems that his staff simply never answers the phone.  It usually takes 2 hours of repeated calling to get an answer.  Who has time for that or wants to deal with it?  I have run into this problem with many other doctors and I just don't get it.  You have office workers, you have patients with medical needs, why isn't anyone answering the phone?  It's incomprehensible and not work the aggravation.  It's with regret that I feel that I have to give Dr. Goldberg 2 stars.  \n",

I think I was one of his 1st patients when he started at MHMG. He's been great over the years and is really all about the big picture. It is because of him, not my now former gyn Dr. Markoff, that I found out I have fibroids. He explores all options with you and is very patient and understanding. He doesn't judge and asks all the right questions. Very thorough and wants to be kept in the loop on every aspect of your medical health and your life.  \n",
       "2       I don't know what Dr. Goldberg was like before  moving to Arizona, but let me tell you, STAY AWAY from this doctor and this office. I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money.  \n",

Jason and Ryan came out last fall and did a wonderful job pruning, etc.  Called them to come back this spring and no response after first call.  After second call, I was told they could only come on a Monday.  I work Mondays, and left a message what days would work for me. NEVER heard back from them!  After 3 calls, nothing.  Very UNRELIABLE and UNACCOMMODATING..  \n",

I called him this morning for some sprinkler help and some potential landscaping for my backyard. He showed up to my house within an hour and answered all of my questions! When I showed him how my irrigation box was leaking, he knew right away what to do - he went a grabbed a new part out of his truck, put it on, and it was fixed! He then set up my watering timer and we talked about some landscaping and pricing. His prices seemed great and I will definitely use him in the future! To top it all off, when I asked him what I owed him for fixing my irrigation leak and his time, he said don't worry about it! I was shocked and couldn't believe his service! Thank you so much Ryan!  \n",
